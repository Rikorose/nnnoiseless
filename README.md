`nnnoiseless` is a rust crate for suppressing audio noise. It is a (safe) rust port of
the [`RNNoise`][1] C library, and is based on a recurrent
neural network.

While `nnnoiseless` is meant to be used as a library, a simple command-line
tool is provided as an example. It operates on RAW 16-bit little-endian mono
PCM files sampled at 48 kHz. It can be used as:

```
cargo run --release --example nnnoiseless INPUT.raw OUTPUT.raw
```

The output is also a 16-bit raw PCM file.

## C-API

It is possible to install `nnnoiseless` as C-API library, with a [`RNNoise`][1]-compatible header.

``` sh
# cargo install cargo-c
# cargo cinstall --destdir /tmp/staging-nnnoiseless
# sudo cp -a /tmp/staging-nnnoiseless/* /
```
